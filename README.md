# Bangla Handwritten Character Recognition 
This is the code of Undergrad thesis work

The thesis work is be divided into 4 sections.
  1. Image preprocessing: Grayscaling, Binarization, Renaming, Augmentation(Rotate, Shift, Noise)
  2. CNN model for character recognition: A previously built model will be used to understand the workflow of CNN based character recognition
  3. LSTM model for character recognition: A model will be built and used to understand the workflow of LSTM based character recognition
  4. Hybrid CNN-LSTM model for character recognition: CNN will be used for feature extraction and LSTM for recognition
